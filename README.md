# A proteogenomic approach to discover novel lncRNA-derived peptides

This Repositories was used to include codes used in the project “A practical proteogenomic approach to discover novel lncRNA-derived peptides and their potential clinical utility in hepatocellular carcinoma” (unpublished).

Most of the code in this project is implemented by existing R packages (including Cran and bioconductor), and some of the code is implemented by a customized toolkit called TNSMD, which can be found at TNSMD (https://github.com/lbwfff/TNSMD).
